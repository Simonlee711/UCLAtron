#### STILL IMPLEMENTING ###
Implements a variety of methods to verify that the concept is indeed forgotten:
1. Direct performance drop on the 'forgotten' concept tasks.
2. Contrastive evaluation with probes.
3. Embedding/logit drift.
4. Counterfactual testing.
5. (Optional) Membership inference attacks.
